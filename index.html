    Lesson 1 
    <br><br>
    In this lesson, we learned about how functions could be generalized and used in more than one situation through psuedocode and examples.
    <br><br>
    What will print to the console after running this code segment?
    <br><br>
    console.log(numbers(3,2));
    <br>
    function numbers(num1, num2){
    <br>
    var answer;
    <br>
    answer = num1 + num 2;
    <br>
    answer = answer + num1;
    <br>
    return answer * num2
    <br>
    }
    <br><br>
    16.

    Lesson 2 
    <br><br>
    In this lesson, we learned more about parameters and how they can be used in functions in order to generalize them, as well as the benefits of doing so.
    <br><br>
    What are the benefits of writing functions that use parameters and return? Try to list at least two.
    <br><br>
    Writing a function that uses a parameter and return is helpful because you don't have to write multiple functions that do the same thing, making your code repetitive in nature. Instead, using parameters and returns help keep your code less bulky allowing for easier comprehension as well as easier debugging.

    Lesson 3 
    <br><br>
    In this lesson, we practiced figuring out more about parameters and different ways they're used by going through programs and understanding them. We also decoded them and tried to make a few ourselves in order to better understand their usage.
    <br><br>
    The procedure below will be called twice with two numbers provided as arguments to the parameter myNumber. Which of the following pair of numbers will mystery return the same value?
    <br><br>
    PROCEDURE mystery (myNumber)
    <br>
    final = 0
    <br>
    IF (myNumber > 100){
    <br>
    final = 100
    <br>
    } else {
    <br>
    IF (myNumber < 0){
    <br>
    final = 0
    <br>
    } ELSE {
    <br>
    final = myNumber
    <br>
    }}
    <br>
    return [final]
    <br><br>
    100 and 200.

    Lesson 4 
    <br><br>
    In this lesson, we programmed a pre-existing app with return values and parameters in order to familiarize ourselves with it.
    <br><br>
    You can find this app in the menu.
